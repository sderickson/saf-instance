To get started on a new project:

1. Create a folder in /notes with the name of the feature, prefixed with today's date, like "2025-03-20 project-init"
2. Make a copy of [the SAF checklist template](/saf-2025/docs/checklist-template.md) in that folder, call it "checklist.md".
3. Begin going through that checklist.
